# Welcome to the FoundryZombie game repository!

FoundryZombie is a fun and interactive way to learn about blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. 

The game is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to track ownership of the zombies. This means that players will have true ownership of their zombies and can trade them with other players on the blockchain.

The game is still in development and we welcome any contributions and feedback.

Thank you for your interest in FoundryZombie and we look forward to playing the game with you!
